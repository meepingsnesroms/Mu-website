# The last 2 months have been complete chaos.

There hasn't been any progress updates for awhile(or much progress at all), I haven't been able to work on Mu like I used to.
Its not cancelled or on indefinite hold, progress is just really slow because over the last 2 months everything has been a mess, my mom got paranoid schizophrenia from a year long drug addiction, I moved out(alone to a hotel, first time ever spending a day alone), she ran away, I had to do multiple long road trips to the mental facility she was stuck at, pick up a car left at a campground, went back, dealt with another psychotic episode, moved out again(with my dad this time), she ran away again, came back and moved into our new apartment, had another psychotic episode, refused to get off drugs and was asked to leave.

When I was in the hotel alone I fixed UART1/2 for OS 4 and have gotten some of the OS 5 CPU features emulated, but no booting for OS 5 yet(probably would have been if this didn't happen).

Even when I did have time this whole scenario was a real motivation killer, its hard to think about a CPUs I2C bus when you have to worry about someone throwing away all your food because "its poisoned", unplugging the water heater because "the military replaced it" with an identical one and flipping all the circuit breakers because "they are remote controlled by someone else"(these actually happened, living there was like living in a tiny third world country, unsafe people, unreliable food, water, power, at some point you stop doing everything because you don't know if it will get sabotaged half way through by a circuit breaker flip).

Things are still messy but I have my own space and time again, am now starting to play games and work on Mu again instead of staring at the wall or surfing the internet mindlessly.

Progress should pick up more around December or January, I still have other problems not related to this I have to get fixed before I can obsess about Palm OS all day again, but will be working on it the best I can till then.
