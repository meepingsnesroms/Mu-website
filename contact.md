### If you contact me by other methods I cannot guarantee you are actualy talking to me or that others have not read your message!
### If using the RetroArch port please report bugs that occur in all libretro cores to libretro, if you dont know you can report it to me and I will forward it if necessary.

You may contact me for anything Palm OS related and expect a response within a week, any other topics will most likely get a response but one is not guaranteed.
